# Predicting-Diabetes-in-Patients-using-Machine-Learning-models
This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in individuals using machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) Logistic regression and Decision Tree models.

# Dataset:
- The dataset used for this analysis likely includes the following features:
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).  
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- BMI: Body Mass Index.
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).
- Age: Age in years.
- Outcome: Class variable (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes).
