# Predicting-Diabetes-in-Patients-using-Machine-Learning-models
This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in individuals using machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) Logistic regression and Decision Tree models.

# Dataset:
- The dataset used for this analysis likely includes the following features:
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).  
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- BMI: Body Mass Index.
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).
- Age: Age in years.
- Outcome: Class variable (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes).

# Conclusion

The below aggregated table shows the performance of various models, apart from the performance of the other resources time required to train and deploy the model the computational complexity and option for parallel training needs to be considered.
